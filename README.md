## NeuralNetwork ##
Simple neural network in C# for further training and testing

Check error rate changes after further training. Make the network learn your own patterns. Look back from a given output to the corresponding input. Explore the "vision" of this special pattern the network has.
A working Live Demo of this tool you can find on [jojo-studio.de](http://jojo-studio.de/)
